1. $A \cap B$ is the set of outcomes that are in  *both* $A$ and $B$.
2. $A \cup B$ is the set of outcomes that are in *either* $A$ or $B$ (or both).
3. $\overline{A}$ is the set of outcomes that are *not* in $A$ (but are in $S$). 
4. $A \setminus B$ is the set of outcomes that are in $A$ and not in $B$.
