# Methods

This chapter uses `ggplot` [@R-ggplot2]

\index{ggplot}\index{quakes}

```{theorem}
Theorem blocks don't work well.  Here is why:

1. If you have a list
2. At the end
3. It breaks the latex.

```

Here is a plot:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(quakes,aes(x=long,y=lat))+geom_point()
```

## Exercises {-}
@doubles.
    a. Create a scatterplot of the number of doubles hit in each year from 1871-2015.
    b. Create a scatterplot of the number of doubles hit in each year from 1871-2015 in each league. Color the NL blue and the AL red.
@totalruns. Create boxplots for total runs scored per year in the AL and the NL from 1969-2015. 
@lifeba.
    a. Create a histogram of lifetime batting averages (H/AB) for all players who have at least 1000 career AB's. 
    b. In your histogram from (d), color the NL blue and the AL red. (If a player played in both the AL and NL, count their batting average in each league if they had more than 1000 AB's in that league.)
    
    &nbsp;
@birthmonth. Use the `People` data set from the `Lahman` library.
    a. Create a barplot of the birthmonths of all players. (Hint: `geom_bar()`)
    b. Create a barplot of the birth months of the players born in the USA after 1970.

Exercises @babycount - @jessie use the `babynames` data set from the `babynames` library, which you probably need to install.

@babycount. Make a line graph showing the total number of babies of each sex, plotted over time.
@namescount. Make a line graph showing the number of different names used for each sex, plotted over time.
@yourname. Make a line graph showing how many babies of your gender have your name, plotted over time.  If your name doesn't appear in the data, use the female name "Alexa".
@bryan. Make a line graph comparing the number of boys named Bryan and the number of boys named Brian from 1920 to the present.
@jessie. I wish that I had Jessie's girl, or maybe Jessie's guy? One one graph, plot the number of male and female babies named Jessie over time.

    Three time periods show up in the history of Jessie:

    - More male than female Jessie
    - More female than male Jessie
    - About the same male and female Jessie.
    
    Approximately what range of years does each time period span?

@assaults. Data scientist Kieran Healy created this widely circulated figure:
