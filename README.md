This is a bookdown book with minimal content but powerful additional functionality.  It is the tech behind [Foundations of Statistics with R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/) by Darrin Speegle and Bryan Clair.

Some features:

* Chapters can have arbitrary names.
* Knit then merge makes each chapter in its own R session.
* Single chapter PDF build (!)
* Indexing.
* More things in `.gitignore`.
* Exercise naming/numbering with simple `@name.` syntax
* Exercise solution handling
* R library detection and listing
* Makefile for complex build tasks while still allowing RStudio Knit and Build to work smoothly.

If you intend to use bookdown for a long textbook with exercises,
this is the complete package.
